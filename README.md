# 🚀 42 Python Immersion

This repository contains my work from the **42 Python Immersion** — an intensive practical bootcamp-style journey through Python programming.

The goal of this immersion is to build a strong foundation in Python through structured weekly exercises, real-world examples, and hands-on projects. The repository is organized into week-based folders that reflect the progression of topics.

## 📁 Repository Structure

📦 **42_Python_Immersion**
├── **week_1/** – Basics of Python: core syntax, variables, control flow  
├── **week_2/** – Intermediate concepts: functions, modules, collections  
├── **.gitignore** – Ignored files configuration  

> Each `week_X` folder includes exercises and/or scripts designed around a specific theme or topic by a pdf subject learned during that week.
